# Diabetes

This project predicts which patients have diabetes based on ten baseline variables:
- age
- sex
- body mass index
- average blood pressure
- and six blood serum measurements

The data is from 442 diabetes patients.

The target variable is the response of interest, a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after the baseline.
